Daily Water Intake App
Version 


This app takes into account the temperature, weight, and if you're pregnant and breastfeeding to tell you how much water you should be drinking a day. 

Start with putting in your name and the program will ask you a series of questions. At the end of the program, it will tell you how many ounces of water to drink that day, and also translate it into a graph.
